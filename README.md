# International-Debt-Statistics
We are not the only ones that often have to turn towards obtaining loans to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. International debt data collected by [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/debt-statistics) was analyzed. Throughout this analysis, the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries is viewed and compared. 

## We are going to find the answers to questions like:

- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
